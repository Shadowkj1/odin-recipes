            <h3>
                Japanese rice balls, also known as onigiri or omusubi, are a staple of Japanese 
                lunch boxes (bento). They are usually shaped into rounds 
                or triangles by hand, and they're fun to make and eat.

            Much like sandwiches in the West, onigiri is readily available in convenience stores across Japan, 
            and it's great for a quick and easy savory snack. 
            They're perfect for an on-the-go eat, too, 
            with no need for utensils or to heat them up. 
            Recently, they have enjoyed a surge of popularity 
            among food trucks where they are made fresh and grilled 
            lightly to order. However, making onigiri at home is 
            irresistibly economical and easy.
