                This easy sponge cake recipe is passed down from my mom, a retired pastry chef, which I've simplified to make it easy for the home baker. It's an incredibly fluffy, soft, moist, and light cake which can be used with any frosting and filling.

            Sponge cake is a light and airy cake that's that's leavened with beaten eggs instead of yeast. Sometimes baking powder is added for more volume. The beaten eggs act as a rising agent, giving the cake a fluffy, light texture.
