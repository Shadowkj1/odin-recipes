        Street Tacos have gotten more and more popular over the years. 
        The difference between these and <em>“regular tacos”</em> is that these are 
        typically in smaller tortillas. The reason they are smaller is that
        when people ordered them off of the vendor carts or food trucks, they 
        wanted them to be able to hold the taco with one hand while walking down the street. Hence the name <strong>“street tacos.”</strong>
